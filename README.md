#GCP-templates-assesment

These are my GCP templates and schemas for assignment 1 of Cloud Computing module. These had to allow for the development and repeatable deployment of scalable cloud services for a large organisation.

If you want to deploy them into GCP, you have to use the main.yaml file. In this file, you also specify the number, names and links to other resources.
